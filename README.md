# README

Task 1)   Local dev & deploy env.   

Create a fresh Rails 5.1 app, Ruby 2.4.1.   Include these gems:
	ActiveAdmin
	activeadmin-addons
	Enumerize
	Lograge
	pry-byebug (dev only, of course)
Create a model with a few fields, one of them enumerized.   
Write something in seed.rb to fill in 50-100 records.   
Configure AA access to it
Commit to a new Github repo.   
Deploy to a free-level Heroku server.   

Task 2)   System (aka integration) testing and AA mods.  

Read up on the Rails 5.1 incorporation of Capybara-Selenium-Chrome as default system-test framework, in Minitest.    We're trying to stick to that.  

Go test-first for these minor mods on your sample application:  
  a) limit index columns to just a few.    Exclude the id column.   
  b) make a new column (list view only)  that combines a string and the id, *and that value should link to the view page of the object*
	e.g.   "Thing Title (id 8)"    
  c) limit filters to just the enumerized field (pulldown),  and _contains search in a text field.  
  d) limit download links to just csv, and a second copy of the download link *above* the list.     
  e) similarly, add a second results count  up top.  
	This one should not include pagination links or counts.   Just "N matching #{model_plural}"
